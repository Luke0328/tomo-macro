# tomo-macro

For running the code locally, please have two terminals ready. One terminal should be open in the client directory, and the other in the server directory. Run 'npm start' in both of those directories to run the app. Please also note that this project has several branches. To view the main components we've been working on thus far, take a look at the meal and recipes branch.
